## gRPC + REST Gateway Play

After following the codelab by the Google Cloud team https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-grpc/ and reading the blog post about gRPC + REST Gateway from CoreOS https://coreos.com/blog/gRPC-protobufs-swagger.html. I figured it would be cool to continue the same codelab by adding support of an alternative RESTful API using the [gRPC Gateway]: https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
